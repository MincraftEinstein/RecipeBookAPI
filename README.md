### **üìò Description**
If you use Fabric or Jared's [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template) (like me),
then there's not really a way to add recipe book support for custom recipe types.
This mod solves that issue by adding a simple system that works with vanilla and allows for some customization

[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) required for Fabric version
